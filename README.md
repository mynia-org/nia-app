# Nia – Open Source Dating App (iOS)

**Nia** is a fully open-source, community-focused dating app, designed with privacy, transparency, and inclusivity in mind.

> 📱 This repository contains the iOS client of the Nia platform.

## 🌟 Vision

We're building a non-profit, transparent alternative to the major dating platforms.  
No ads. No tracking. No paywalls. Just people – matched fairly and respectfully.

---

## 🎯 Our Mission
At Nia, our goal is to help people focus on real connection, not subscriptions.
We’re not here to maximize profit — we’re here to maximize meaningful matches.

This app is designed for true success, not business metrics.

Our purpose is simple: to make people happier.
Because there’s nothing greater we can offer someone than happiness.
